CompID: DublinPickNMix2026
Competitor Limit: 54

The competition is run as 'fixed seating', so there is a strict maximum of 18 competitors per group.

This competition features two kinds of scheduling:
- Normal Scheduling
- Parallel Scheduling

Normal Scheduling:
- Competitors are broken into different groups in a balanced way
- - i.e. the fastest people are in different groups (so that there are scramblers)
- Judges, Runners, and Scramblers are assigned
- This happens for all rounds where there is a single event occuring at that time
- Subsequent rounds (i.e. round 2s) are assigned during the competition based on results achieved
- - Fastest people are in the last groups etc.
- Delegates de-prioritised for task allocation

Parallel Scheduling:
- Competitors may have selected to compete in one or more events which are occuring at the same time
- These events are run in waves, such that each competitor can choose what order to compete in
- Each competitor is assigned a group number for each of their events which is their wave number
- Each competitor will be assigned the same station for all of their events
- For judges, runners, and scramblers, each competitor will staff for at most 1 wave
- - i.e. each competitor will have at least 1 rest wave
- Scramblers are assigned ensuring that there are at least some scramblers able to scramble for each event in that wave
- - This means that its not a simple wave 1 = compete, wave 2 = rest, wave 3 = staff and rotate
- Wave allocations are made trying to minimise the number of events in each wave
- - This should be solved to be the optimal solution

For making staff assignments, the top goal is:
- 4 scramblers
- 2 runners
- 18 judges

Where there are not enough staff, we should reduce the number of judges
- i.e. if there are 18 people not resting and not competing, then we will have 12 judges, 4 scramblers, and 2 runners

Validations:
- Ensure each person is assigned to staff and compete in at most 1 wave
- Ensure no person is set to staff for a group (normal)/wave (parallel) and compete in that group
- Ensure that there are never more than competitors 18 in a group/wave
- Ensure we are optimising the number of events per wave
